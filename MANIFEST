# TODO Add Track→&Clone 0.9.2
# This will _copy_ the current track in the current list (ready to be
# moved elsewhere so as to make it easy to add the same track to
# multiple lists).
# TODO Add Track→&Bookmark 0.9.3
# This will _copy_ the current track into the <Bookmarks> list which
# will be created as the _first_ list if it doesn't exist already (just
# like the <Deleted> list).
# TODO Implement update_ui() 0.9.4
# This should activate/deactivate all menu options & toobar buttons
# depending on the state (has_track, has_history, has_list <since all
# tracks could be list-less at the top-level>).
# NOTE subtle bug: if a list is followed by a track the track gets
# subsumed as the last item of the list.
