All menu options have a keyboard accelerator. For example to play or
pause use <b>Alt+T,P</b>. All common operations also have keyboard
shortcuts, so again for play or pause use <b>F6</b>. To change the
volume lick the volume slider (or press the <b>F9</b> or <b>F8</b>
keys). Similarly, click the time slider to change the position in the
currently playing track.
</p>
<p>
To discover the keyboard accelerators and shortcuts navigate the menus
using the <b>Alt</b> key (e.g., <b>Alt+F</b> to pull down the File
menu), sinc all the keys are shown. Or, for the shortcuts, simply hover
the mouse over each toolbar button.

Instead of undo/redo, when deleting a list or track it will simply be
moved to a list at the end called <i>&lt;Deleted&gt;</i> (which will be
created if necessary). You can move any list or track from the 
<i>&lt;Deleted&gt;</i> list back into one of your own lists at any time.
But if you delete a list or track that's already in the
<i>&lt;Deleted&gt;</i> list you will be prompted to confirm the deletion
and if you confirm then the list or track will be permanently deleted.

The File menu can be used to show the Configure dialog. This dialog can
be used to set the scale of the user interface, and to set how many
tracks may appear in the history menu amongst other things.
